<p>A ROAAS acts as a cognitive aid for the pilot, whereby the system helps in alleviating workload by providing decision making information. The AR project seeks to provide visual information, more specifically 3DAR (3-dimensional augmented reality) symbology in the form of conformal contours across the runway.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are three main components that allow the program to function:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>X-Plane 11 plugin to calculate take-off perfomance</li><li>.dll file that acts as a shared memory component</li><li>Unity program that renders symbology to AR lens</li></ul>

<p>The program is developed to be compatible with the Dreamglass AR lens, with the plugin compatible with X-plane 11.</p>
